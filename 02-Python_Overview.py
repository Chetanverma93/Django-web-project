# Python Overview


# Why Python ?

"""
Python is a :- high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language.

Python is designed to be highly readable.

"""


# Why Python is Interpreted ?

"""
Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it
"""


# Why Python is Interactive ?

"""
Because python has two modes : 
    
1. Normal Mode :- 
The normal mode is the mode where the scripted and finished .py files and run in the python  interpreter.

2. Interactive Mode :-
Interactive Mode is a command line shell which gives immediate feedback for each statement .

"""


# Why Python is Object-Oriented ?

"""
Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.
"""


# Why Python is a Beginner's Language ?

"""
Python is a great language for the beginner-level.
"""

# Node

"""
Python is derived from many other languages, including ABC, Modula-3, C, C++, Algol-68, SmallTalk, and 
Unix shell and other scripting languages.
"""


# Python Features

"""
Easy-to-learn
Easy-to-read
Easy-to-maintain
A broad standard library
Interactive Mode
Portable
Extendable
Databases
GUI Programming
Scalable
"""


# Why Easy-to-learn ?

"""
Simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax
"""

# Why Easy-to-read ?

"""
Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
"""


# Why Easy-to-maintain ?

"""
Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
"""


# Why A broad standard library ?

"""
Python  library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on 
UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
"""

# Why Interactive Mode ?

"""
Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
"""


# Why Portable ?

"""
Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and 
has the same interface on all platforms.
"""


# Why Extendable ?

"""
You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter.
"""


# Why Databases ?

"""
Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
"""


# Why GUI Programming ?

"""
Python supports GUI application.
"""


# Why Scalable ?

"""
Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.
